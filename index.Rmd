## Project thoughts

I am interested in exploring data related to punishment and crime deterrence. Mass incarceration in the United States is partly the result of widespread attitudes that federal and state authorities should be tough on crime. While safety is a legitimate concern, I wonder if long sentences and other punitive aspects of the American criminal justice system are necessary to reduce crime. Thus, in my project I will examine countries with lenient, moderate, and very punitive criminal justice systems and analyze rates of crime and rates of recidivism in those jurisdictions.

One source that I found so far that could be useful is:


1. National Crime Victimization Survey, 2005 (https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/national-crime-victimization-survey-2005): data on personal and household victimization through an ongoing survey of a nationally-representative sample of residential addresses since 1973.
